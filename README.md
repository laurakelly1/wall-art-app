There are currently no artworks hanging in my home! Along with the commitment issues I have, I struggled to imagine the chosen artwork bringing my living room alive. Enter: Still Wall.

<br>
This website allows users to search through the Art Institute of Chicago's database and see their chosen image displayed on a mockup of a wall at home. It makes choosing easy!
