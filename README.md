<h1> Wall Art App </h1>
This website will allow users to search through the Chicago Institute of Artâ€™s database and see their chosen image displayed on a mockup of a wall at home.

The wall will be basic, maybe include a chair in front and a plant. I want the wall color to be able to change depending on what the user has at home.

The art will be pulled from the API and placed in the middle of the wall.

Optional features to include in this iteration or another:
<li>Changing the rooms (bathroom, kitchen etc.) </li>
<li>Change the size of the artwork </li>
<li>Change the frame design</li>
