There are currently no artworks hanging in my home! Along with the finacial commitment issues I have, I struggled to imagine the chosen artwork bring my living room alive. Enter: Still Wall.

This website allows users to search through the Chicago Institute of Artâ€™s database and see their chosen image displayed on a mockup of a wall at home. It makes the imagining easy!
